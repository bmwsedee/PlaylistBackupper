PlaylistBackupper
=================
This script reads all playlists in "C:\Users\Ben\Music\Afspeellijsten".
For every playlist it will create a folder with the name of the playlist, and every file mentioned in the playlist is copied into this folder.
Logging is done inside the folder "\logs" where a new file is created every day the script is run.
At the end of the script an information box containing the word 'Done' is shown.
